In this assignment, you'll build a data structure called a trie (usually pronounced "try",
though it comes from the word retrieval). This is a tree structure that can be used for
efficient storage and retrieval of strings. Each node in a trie represents a character, and
paths from the root to leaf nodes represent words. Tries are commonly used for tasks
such as autocomplete and spell checking.
